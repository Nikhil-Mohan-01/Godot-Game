# Godot-Game
This is a Magical Platformer game, in which the players must work together to retrieve an ancient artifact. 

The character class are going to be for example:
	player, frog, other creatures. 
	
Currently I want to make the game a single player game
where there are portals that transform you into the other creatures


You can play this game in the on itch, however this game is still under development and might not work as well **https://nikhil-mohan.itch.io/retriver**
